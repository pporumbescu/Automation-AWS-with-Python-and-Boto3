Based on the list of Python scripts you provided, it appears that these scripts are focused on automating various tasks related to AWS Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and Elastic Block Store (EBS) services. Here's a suggested README description for your GitHub repository:

# AWS Automation Scripts

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts designed to automate various tasks and operations within the Amazon Web Services (AWS) ecosystem. These scripts leverage the Boto3 library, which is the AWS SDK for Python, to interact with different AWS services programmatically.

## Script Descriptions

1. **add-env-tags.py**: This script allows you to add tags to AWS resources based on their environment (e.g., development, staging, production). Tags can help you organize and manage your AWS resources more effectively.

2. **cleanup-snapshots.py**: This script helps you clean up and delete old or unused EBS snapshots, which can accumulate over time and consume storage space. It provides a way to automate the snapshot management process.

3. **create-ec2-backup.py**: This script creates EBS snapshots for the volumes attached to your EC2 instances, enabling you to back up your instance data regularly.

4. **ec2-create.py**: This script automates the process of creating new EC2 instances based on your specified configurations, such as instance type, AMI, and security groups.

5. **ec2-delete.py**: This script allows you to terminate or delete existing EC2 instances, providing a convenient way to manage your compute resources.

6. **ec2-status-check.py**: This script checks the status of your EC2 instances and provides information about their current state (e.g., running, stopped, terminated).

7. **monitor-website.py**: This script monitors the availability and uptime of a website or web application by periodically checking its status and sending notifications if it becomes unavailable.

8. **rstore-volume.py**: This script helps you restore an EBS volume from a previously created snapshot, enabling you to recover data or create new volumes based on existing snapshots.

## Prerequisites

Before running these scripts, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.x installed on your system
- Boto3 library installed (`pip install boto3`)
- AWS credentials configured (AWS Access Key ID and AWS Secret Access Key)

## Usage

Each script has its own set of parameters and configurations that need to be provided. You can find the specific usage instructions and examples within the script files themselves or in the accompanying documentation (if available).

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you have any improvements, bug fixes, or additional scripts to share, please feel free to submit a pull request. Make sure to follow the existing code style and provide clear documentation for your changes.
